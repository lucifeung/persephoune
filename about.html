  <p>
    Since I was little, I have always been into different types of art like drawing, painting, sewing, making poems, doing clay sculptures, etc. Despite that, it took me a very long time to persuade my parents to let me try following the type of career that I love, and not what they want or what they think is "best for me". Before moving to the US, I was already a third year college student in a non-art major that my parents chose for me - because I never really knew what kind of major or career I wanted to pursue. Not until my family moved to San Jose 5 years ago, was I able to put my first step on the path I dreamed about when I was little. Now that I am finally able to go on the road I have always desired, I am trying my best to learn more about art, especially digital art, in order to achieve my dream. I really want to be a famous illustrator, character developer, or just any type of career that allows me to draw and create in digital media. Although my artworks, for now, are still a bit clumsy compared to other professional artists; I am still striving to learn more everyday, and I hope that someday in the future, I will be able to look back on myself and realize how much I've grown.
