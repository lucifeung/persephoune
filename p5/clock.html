<h1> Clock Sketch </h1>
 <br>
<p> (<strong>Artist statement</strong>)
   <br> In this sketch I used the a boba drink to create the sense of time changing according to the time I usually go to get my boba drink. From 6am to 6pm, which is 18 o'clock, there will be a morning sky with the sun moving from left to right due to the real-time hour, and at night, which is from 6pm to 6am, will have a nightsky with the moon moving from left to right with the same pattern. From 4:30 to 4:35 pm will be the time I go out to buy my boba drink for the day, so at that exact time there will be a sentence pop up saying that "It's boba time!"</p>
